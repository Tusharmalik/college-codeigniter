Krishna Engineering College, in its twelve years of existence, has always shown a positive graph of growth in all areas of functionality. The institution has always endeavored to provide a value based academic curriculum to all the enrolled students through well experienced, motivated and highly qualified faculties.<br /><br />As India moves progressively towards becoming a ‘knowledge economy’ it becomes increasingly important that Professionals/Engineers focus on advancement of skills. Gone are the days when a B.Tech degree from the university with a traditional prescribed curriculum was sufficient to get a job. In the present day knowledge economy and fast changing technical contours, university curriculum coupled with re-added programs &amp; certified add on course are need of the hour to bridge the gap between industry and the academia. To succeed in an era of globalization, rapid changes and fierce competition, engineers must therefore possess a diversity of skills and must meet the market’s requirements.<br /><br />We, at KEC, focus on cutting edge technology, innovations and creativity, hands on learning with an objective to impart a unique global exposure so as to empower youth to face the brave new world.
