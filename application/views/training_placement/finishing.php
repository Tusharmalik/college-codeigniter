    <p>Due to a variety of factors, today’s business environment is becoming more complex, uncertain and competitive. All types of organizations consider human resources as their key asset, which plays a critical role in organizational performance and success. Most employers are likely to hire, retain and promote persons who are dependable, resourceful, ethical, having effective communication, self directed, willing to work and learn, and having positive attitude. Soft skills fulfill an important role in shaping an individual’s personality by complementing his/her hard skills.<br /><br />Knowing this fact, we are shaping our students not only to crack the first interview &amp; get a job, but also providing them life skills so they can grow well as a professional.<br /><br />To cater to this need of the industry &amp; bridge Industry academia gap, KEC has introduced an Intense &amp; well structured training Program for our students. <br />In order to produce Smart professions, we are providing Soft skills training in 3rd &amp; 4th semester as a part of their curriculum on various topics like Communication, Attitude, Personal Grooming &amp; Dressing, Resume Writing, Teamwork, Leadership, Time Management,  stress management &amp; Time management.<br /><br />In 5th and 6th semester, KEC has a comprehensive program designed to train students for all stages of Campus recruitments. This program has different modules for written test or aptitude test, group discussions and personal interviews and is updated on regular basis to keep pace with the changes in the recruitment procedures adopted by various companies at campuses. Our team of experts has studied the recruitment process of companies like Infosys, TCS, and Wipro etc. to design a curriculum which will help the students to be better prepared for their placement process.  <br /><br />All the areas normally covered in the aptitude tests of most companies’ i.e. quantitative ability, verbal, Reasoning and basic computer skills are covered in detail in the training module offered at KEC. Students get practice exercises and test papers for each test area followed by comprehensive tests on the pattern of the tests conducted by major companies.<br /><br />To prepare the students for the next stages i.e. group discussions and interviews, classes are conducted on communication skills, GD and interview basics, mock GDs and mock interviews (HR and Technical interviews).</p>
